title: History of the MOS 6502
tags: history, 6502
---

Earlier this year I gave a talk at a local meetup for programmers called
[pdxbyte](http://pdxbyte.org/). My talk focused on the historical siginificance
of the MOS 6502 CPU.

> The MOS 6502 might be the most historically significant processor for one
> reason: It fueled the PC revolution. You have probably used a device with a
> 6502, and maybe even programmed one, but do you know the historical context
> for it and what made it successful? This talk briefly covers the following
> aspects of the 6502: the events that lead to its creation, the elegance of
> the design, and the lessons we can learn from its success.


Thanks to the wonderful pdxbyte organizers and voluteers my talk is now
available on youtube:

I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed researching the 6502.
